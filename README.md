# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance between two points.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculation.
### Step 2:
Get the 2 points from the user.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4:
Print the distance.
### Step 5:
End the program

## PROGRAM:
```python
#Program to find the distance between two points.
#Developed by: R LAKSHANA
#RegisterNumber: 22004909
import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
  
## OUTPUT:
